Dice rolling game(python)
## Overview
This is a straightforward command-line dice rolling game created in Python. It accommodates 2 to 4 players, with the goal of being the first to reach 50 points. Players take turns rolling a die, and the points from each roll are added to their score. However, if a player rolls a 1, their turn ends immediately, and they lose the points accumulated during that turn.
